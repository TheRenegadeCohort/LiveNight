Hello Cohort 19!

You've been selected for a secret project.

We've been working a bit and, like a freshly-bitten Peter Parker, it's time to see what we can do. I know that I personally haven't had anything in our skillbuilders / pair programming yet that has been the kind of passionate excitement that we are all getting into web development for.

We're here to build.

That being said, Mr. Kyle Combs took an opportunity to show off one of his projects where he would make a playlist of artists playing in your area tonight. It does not work. I like that idea though and I think it would make an excellent team project.

So that's why I've brought you all here.

We are going to take an opportunity to remind ourselves why we're in this program. We wanna build something cool and use the skills we have to make something we can be proud of.

So it's time to take this Charlie Brown Christmas tree of a website, really around it and solidify our place in the annals of CodeSmith as the overachiever cohort by submitting a Pull Request to one of our instructor's projects.

- If you would like to contribute, fork and clone this repo. Commit often and submit pull requests to the master branch of this repo. All PRs will be reviewed manually... because we haven't gone over the CI/CD lessons yet. Set this repo as UPSTREAM and then run the following command: 
  $ git remote set-url --push upstream DISABLED

- All feature requests and suggestions should go into the issues section of this repo.

The expectation is to be able to submit our PR on June 21st. Until then, this project is to remain secret.

This project needs people to do the following:

- SongKick Auth

- Spotify Auth (Steve B has an account and will be providing API keys)

- React component architecture

- Express backend architecture

- UI / UX

Despite this project being a little cheeky, it's not malicious. The expectation is that those people contributing will be working to better the project as best as they can.

It's time to try doing something to get our morale back while learning how all these pieces fit together.

- The Renegade Cohort
